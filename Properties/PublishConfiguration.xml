	<LongDescription>**City Services Redux**

Tweaks and modifies City Service buildings to your liking. By default, you could just install this mod and enjoy it as-is.

- This has a curated preset list that increases the **number of workers** in a City Service (e.g., Central Intelligence) and a few other small adjustments (see below for details). 
- Number of configured buildings and extensions: **186**.
- Increased workers automatically increases the wages you pay per building (scaled by the game itself).

### Power Users
- Also supports local configuration, so you can easily tweak the config file as you wish.
- New parameters are only applied to **new buildings**. 
- If you want to change an existing building, it needs to be destroyed and plopped again to see increased employees.


### Features

* Curated Presets: all buildings have more workplaces and some have altered requirements for what education levels are required at that building.
There is no formula used, all have been set manually taking into consideration various aspects. Some have only slightly more workers (2), but some have many more.
* Example: Central Intelligense defaults to 100 is increased to 300 which to add more realism to such a large building.
* Look into Config.xml or RealCity.log to find out about specific buildings, but you can increase or decrease what is in the preset file that comes with the mod.
* Crematorium has 2x higher processing rate to handle increased deaths from Population Rebalance (this won't matter if you use Magic Hearse).
* If you don't like the preset numbers, then use the player-modifiable local Config.xml (from ModsData/RealCity/Config.xml).
* New configuration can be applied/updated even during the game (use options menu).
* To add new components and parameters please refer to info and examples in Config.xml file which can be edited with Notepad++ or similar.

### Technical

* The configuration is applied during the mod initialization and after clicking **Apply Configuration** button. It is possible to apply a new configuration during the game.
* The mod does **not** modify savefiles.
* The mod does **not** modify any game systems.
* The mod can be turned off at any time. Already plopped buildings will retain modded params. New buildings will have ofc vanilla params.
